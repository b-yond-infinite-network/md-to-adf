Feature: Conversion of Codeblock markdown

  Scenario: Base formatting - Code block at the root level
    Given the markdown in GITHUB is :
      |```Javascript                                                                                                   |
      |const testCode = 'this code is good'                                                                            |
      |if( itmustDoSomething good ) console.log( 'yeah' )                                                              |

      |Some paragraph in between                                                                                       |
      |```Python                                                                                                       |
      |const thisCode = 'this code is better'                                                                          |

    When we translate it in ADF
    Then the ADF chunk at content path [ 0 ] has type 'codeBlock'
    And the ADF chunk at content path [ 0 ] contains '{"type": "text", "text": "const testCode = 'this code is good'\nif( itmustDoSomething good ) console.log( 'yeah' )"}'
